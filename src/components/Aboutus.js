                NFTs are non-fungible tokens. They are unique items that you
                can't replace with something else. For example, a one-of-a-kind
                trading card is an NFT – you can't just replace it with any
                other card. If you trade your card for some other card, you have
                something different. These differ from fungible items, which are
                often the same as each other.
